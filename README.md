# PID Tuning by Optimization

This repository contains Python scripts to optimize PID controller gains (proportional, integral, and derivative) using optimization techniques. The optimization aims to minimize the step response characteristics: overshoot, rise time, and settling time.

## Introduction

This repository provides two approaches to optimize PID controller gains:
1. **Gradient Descent**
2. **Quadratic Programming**

The optimization is applied to:
- Transfer Function models
- State Space models

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
